This is the repository for my code Quiz

Here is my quiz so far, still a few things missing as in the ranking, and the start button for starting the timer since i pulled it out into the global scope. 

the functionality for moving from question to question in the quiz itself works quite well, bringing you to a display screen, and showing the score at the end of the quiz. 

I also tried to personalize this quiz with the styling as well, and gave it a little flare with the time given.
