This is the repository for my code Quiz

Here is my quiz so far, I ahve a few errors in this quiz, but the largest would be my [object Object] display on the result page. The inputs do show up in the local stoarage just fine, but I cant seem to shake that error. I have tried multiple different methods for setting my object to a string as well but no dice. 

the functionality for moving from question to question in the quiz itself works quite well, bringing you to a display screen, and showing the score at the end of the quiz. 

I also tried to personalize this quiz with the styling as well, and gave it a little flare with the time given.
